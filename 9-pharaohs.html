    This drill tests your ability to build the code from scratch. You'll create two unordered lists; the first will display the names of the first 5 pharaohs from the 18th dynasty, the second list will display the first 5 from the 19th dynasty.

    Use DOM query selectors to populate:
    - the <code>ul.18th-dynasty</code> with <code>li</code> elements of the first 5 pharaohs from the 18th dynasty.
    - the <code>ul.19th-dynasty</code> with <code>li</code> elements of the first 5 pharaohs from the 19th dynasty.

    You'll need to use your Google skills to find the names of these Pharaohs. Then, store them in appropriate data structures and use JavaScript to automate rendering the names within <code>li</code> elements on the page.
